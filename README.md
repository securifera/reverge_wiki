# Reverge Wiki & Issue Tracker

Welcome to the official GitHub repository for the **Reverge Wiki** and **Issue Tracking**.

Reverge is a proprietary security tool developed by **Securifera** to help security professionals identify, investigate, and validate vulnerabilities across large networks. While the tool itself is not open source, we use this repository to:

- Provide public documentation and usage guides  
- Track issues, feature requests, and feedback from the community  
- Share updates, tips, and how-to content  

## 📘 Documentation

Check the **Wiki** tab for guides, tutorials, and technical reference material on setting up and using Reverge effectively.

## 🐛 Issues and Feedback

Have a question, ran into a bug, or want to request a new feature?  
Use the **Issues** tab to let us know. This is the preferred place for all user-reported issues, even though the main project is closed-source.

Please include as much detail as possible, including:

- A clear description of the problem or request  
- Steps to reproduce (if applicable)  
- Any relevant error messages or screenshots  

## 📫 Contact and Support

If you require private or enterprise support, please contact us directly at [contact@securifera.com](mailto:contact@securifera.com).

Thanks for using Reverge and helping us improve it.
