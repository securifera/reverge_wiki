Scan results can be accessed from two different places in reverge. The main **Dashboard** menu lists scans that have been executed against any target in reverge. The second place is from the **Targets** menu under each specific target. After clicking on a target, click the **Scans** submenu in the top right dialog. To view the details of a scan, click on the corresponding row in the scan table. 

The default page will display basic details about the scan and list all hosts identified. This view will show the IP address for each host,  any domains associated with it, and the number of open ports detected.

## Filter
If you're viewing a very large scan and need to filter the results, click on the <img src="../../assets/chevron.png" alt="Add button" width="30"> button located in the top-left corner of the screen. This will display a filter menu that provides a mechanism for narrowing down the displayed results according to your specific criteria.
